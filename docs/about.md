Hey there! I'm Taylor, and I'm fascinated by the intersection of computation, creativity, and human expression.

This blog explores how these three forces shape our modern world. Why these three? Because they represent some of humanity's most powerful tools for innovation and discovery. The computer—a relatively recent invention in human history—has fundamentally transformed how we create, think, and express ourselves.

Here, you'll find deep dives into:
- Programming techniques that push creative boundaries
- How technology amplifies artistic expression
- The evolution of digital creativity (think: game design, generative art, interactive media)
- Stories of people and projects at the crossroads of tech and creativity

I believe the most interesting discoveries happen when we examine big ideas through small, meaningful details. Each post zooms in on a specific aspect of this vast landscape where logic meets imagination.

Whether you're a developer with an artistic streak, a creator curious about technology, or someone who simply enjoys exploring these intersections, I hope you'll find something here that sparks your curiosity.

Let's explore these territories together.
