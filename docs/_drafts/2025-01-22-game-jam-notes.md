here I am, starting a game jam again. it started on january 17 but I've really done little else but plan and now it is january 22. I created a high level game design document but my mind continues to wander about what the narrative could be. 

I guess that is one important thing to internalize, if I let myself just dream on branches a narrative could take forever I'll never build a game! 

really thought a lot of it is just available time. Between my dayjob and family/house commitments I have a scarce amount of time to spend on this per day. even with the alotted 2 weeks, it is not likely I'll get to a finished product. Thor, the Pirate games founder who runs the community this jam is from, gave some encouraging advice on that front from a live stream, somethign to the effect of "this is a gift of time to yourself, it doesn't matter if you finish or submit or whatever just do it and if you learn something great." Now that is a level of commitment I can get behind.

ok, I'm using godot. I have reasons for this. unreal and unity have some friction to get started and I get bogged down customizing them. I want something a little less opinionated than I imagine gamemaekr studio to be, although that product has consistently been well reviewed and seems like maybe a better first choice. Had to pick something though.

devlog day 1 which was 1/22, for ~ 45 minutes
created a godot project. created a character node following their docs. Could have sworn I've done this before but here we are, I didn't retain it I guess. high level things I learned that I should commit to memory. 

- Scene in godot is like component in other engines, kind of like a recursive-hierarchy for managing and organizing discrete things.
- when creating the player node, I was instructed to click this funny looking button that looks like a weird checkerboard with dots and kind of like one of the adobe pathfinder options for like "erase overlap." What I think it does is make it so taht if the child nodes of this scene node are selected then the whole scene will be selected, kind of like a grouping thing.
- adding a node to the hierarchy is done with command + A (I'm a mac user on this project)
- godot is helpful, it tells you when a resource type has dependencies you haven't fulfilled yet with a warning icon next to it.
- almost immediately I needed assets and was leaving the godot editor to find them. Piskel has this free browser based tool to easily construct tilemaps for pixel art. helpful tutorial here https://youtu.be/FEtFgTolOL0?si=BUABXkS2BIAA6v7I, but then realized it was talkiong about tilemaps. and also realized I was already deviating from the fastest path here. I needed a public domain licensed asset pack so that I didn't start doing an art workflow in the middle of my basic setup. Mechanics first, people! at least that will be my policy because I'm the type that could just start endlessly plunking on a piano or sketching things I like the look of or thinking about plot arcs and never make a thing, as we established earlier. Know thyself, I guess.
-  ok, going to use some Kenney assets to start with, doesn't really matter which. ended up getting their all-in-one bundle because I want to support them and because I like the idea of having several assets to prototype with. that was the end of my time window.
