here  try and define one of or all 3 of creativity, human expression, computation

expression is tricky in some ways, easier to know it when you see it than it is to define. I take the jumble in my head that I don't fully understand, at whatever state it is in at the moment, and then I try to push part of it that I think is important out in such a way that likely someone else consumes it. 

do we have to care if it is consumed for it to be considered expression?
