rough outline: 

- introduce diametrically opposed notions of games if possible or at least start writing on that subject
- Try to identify and articulate the ideal that open world might be chasing what that does and doesn't look like
- full simulation of reality
- fantasy
- intentionally constrained vs. situationally constrained
- comparison between what happens in our minds as children and what a game might spark in us that relates to that
- just try putting words down to capture what you are thinking and feeling about the subject first, then refine

- once you have something relatable distilled out of the mess of thoughts and feelings, come back to what you'd like to open a dialog about in this space, which is your most developed view on what appeals about games that offer a richer decision space, and also the challenges and what breaks down. 

do feel free to quote and draw in examples of differnt schools of thought on the matter and just kind of showcase them
