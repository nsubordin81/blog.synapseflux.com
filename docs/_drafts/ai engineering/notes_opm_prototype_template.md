reasons why your prototype template was eventually successful

- poetry to manage the build 
- every component is its own package which is managed by poetry
- have consistent conventions around package structure, putting the logic for teh component in to the dunder init method, having a src directoyr and a pyproject.toml file

- having a cli.py that is a streamlit app itself so that the outer portion of the app works teh same way as the inner portion. 


I think you should go ahead and write this and open source it yourself.
