## The Setup

My third game jam began on January 17th. Despite the two-week timeline, I only managed brief planning sessions during the first five days. Between work and family commitments, finding time was challenging.

> "This is a gift of time to yourself. It doesn't matter if you finish or submit - just do it and if you learn something, great." 
> - Thor, Pirate Games Founder

This perspective helped me embrace working in 20-minute chunks between life's demands.

## Why Godot?

While I have experience with Unreal and Unity, Godot's approach won me over. Its documentation, intro videos, and courses demonstrate a perfect balance - powerful tools that don't get in your way. For indie developers building focused games, it's ideal. The open-source nature and free licensing are welcome bonuses.

## The Daily Grind

### Day 1: Baby Steps (45 minutes)
* Learned Godot's Scene system (similar to components in other engines)
* Mastered Command + A for adding nodes
* Initially distracted by asset hunting
* Found salvation in Kenney's asset packs

### Days 2-3: Movement Fundamentals
* Debug tip: Check if sprites are in view before troubleshooting
* Discovered Godot's `$` shorthand for node access
* Adapted to Godot's coordinate system (positive Y is down)
* Achievement: Walking sprite in under 2 hours

### Days 4-6: Technical Challenges
* VSCode integration lessons:
  - Close scripts in Godot when using VSCode
  - Debug logs require correct input mapping
  - Animation names must match exactly
* Resisted the platformer perfectionism trap:
  - Avoided premature jump mechanics optimization
  - Focused on learning fundamentals first
  - Accepted "good enough" physics for prototyping

### Days 7-10: Progress Despite Illness
* Maintained micro-sessions following GameDev.tv's Godot course
* Key technical learnings:
  - Collision layer management
  - Signal-based object communication
  - GDScript fundamentals
  - Game mechanics implementation

## Lessons Learned

1. Start simple - resist feature creep
2. Time boxing enhances productivity
3. Check basics first when debugging
4. Leverage community resources
5. Progress over perfection

## What's Next?

Though the game remains unfinished, I gained valuable insights into:
- Godot's capabilities
- Game development workflows
- Maintaining momentum with limited time

I've adjusted my approach by:
1. Setting realistic expectations given current priorities
2. Celebrating consistent engagement over completion
3. Embracing the learning process

I am a game creator in training. Each tutorial and practice session brings me closer to my goals. These building blocks will serve future projects.

_P.S. Consider joining a game jam with a growth mindset. Even without full commitment, the structure motivated me to make time for development. Five additional coding sessions post-jam prove its effectiveness in building habits. Sometimes, gentle accountability beats harsh deadlines._
