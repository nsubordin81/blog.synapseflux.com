After a year-long hiatus, I'm excited to return to my blog and recommit to regular updates. This platform has always been a passion project of mine, and I'm eager to rediscover its potential as a tool for personal expression and creativity. As I originally planned I will be focusing on intersection points between computation, creativity and expression, and I plan to share at least one new post per month. Join me on this journey as I dive back into the world of blogging and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead!

Some topics I hope to cover in the coming months:

- Completing Functional Modularity Series
  - Creating a scala 3 friendly set of examples for the lazy evaluation portion of John Hughes's 'Why Functional Programming' paper
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Sharing my efforts to work with and understand them
  - Ideas for how to leverage them
  - Digging into questions I have about them that others may share
- Helpful Tips
  - Recommendations and time or effort saving tricks I've picked up along the way on my own projects
- Surveys of Computational Creativity
  - Coverage of new and old methods to enhance or supplement creative projects with the help of computation
- Inspired posts
  - in an effort to provided more consistent content, I'll be looking out for writing topics that catch my interest by happenstance

I also look forward to enabling comments on this blog to receive feedback that improves and informs this platform.

I look forward to writing again soon!
