## Large Models Are Here, How Should We Get Started?

I'm starting this blog at a watershed moment in history, when Generative
AI is dominating conversations and oversaturating content feeds. It's hard to ignore the buzz surrounding large and generative models. It is a mammoth in the room if we are talking about computation and creativity today.

There are countless directions to go to write about this, for for now I'll chronicle my attempts to create in this space, and maybe – just maybe – there's value in my struggles.

## Posts To Come

These are some series I will start and populate with posts over the coming months:

1. Use cases with a local model
2. A large language model did my homework (research findings driven by grounded LLMs)
3. Cyborg coding (I write some, you write some. Maybe I have ideas and you write a lot.)
4. Diving into agents
